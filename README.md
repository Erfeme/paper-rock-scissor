# paper-rock-scissor
This version returns the string of who won, instead of showing it in a prompt

What I learned remaking this to return values?

-Importancy of scope in variables
-Use that strange inverted coma ` to have an string and put variables inside with ${}
-how to put a new line in a string with \n
-How conditionals works, tried to use a switch and learned that they can handle only changes in 1 variable at the time, can't make comparissons.
